# [Project Proposal] Qook: From Inspiration to the Table

## 1. Executive Summary
**Qook** is an AI-powered assistant designed to bridge the gap between watching cooking content and actually preparing a meal. Inspired by Eitan Bernath's challenge, Qook streamlines the journey from a YouTube URL to a fully organized, shareable shopping list.

## 2. Problem Statement
* **The Inspiration Gap:** Millions of users watch cooking videos, but the friction of manually transcribing ingredients and steps prevents them from actually cooking.
* **Information Overload:** YouTube videos often contain long intros or side stories, making it hard to find specific cooking instructions quickly.
* **Disconnected Shopping:** There is no easy way to share a required ingredient list with family or roommates directly from a video.

## 3. Target Audience
1. **Busy Home Cooks:** Individuals who want to try new recipes but need to save time on preparation.
2. **Social Media Foodies:** Followers of creators like Eitan Bernath who are looking for a seamless way to follow their favorite chefs.
3. **Collaborative Households:** Families or couples who share grocery shopping duties.
